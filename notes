- Used trim-header.py to remove everything except identifier from the header of genes_UniProt.fasta (as instructed in slides), output to file db.fasta

- Created blast db with the command:
formatdb -i db.fasta -p T

- Command to compare:
echo -e ">TEST\nMADQLTEEQIAEFKEAFSLFDKDGDGTITTKELGTVMRSLGQNPTEAELQDMINEVDADGNGTIDFPEFLTMMARKMKDTDSEEEIREAFRVFDKDGNGYISAAELRHVMTNLGEKLTDEEVDEMIREADIDGDGQVNYEEFVQMMTAK" | blastall -p blastp -d db.fasta -m 8 -b 5

'TEST' is the ID of the sequence that we want to compare followed by a newline and the sequence itself
change -b 6 to the limit of hits you want
Output description: http://www.pangloss.com/wiki/Blast

- There seems to be repitition in the database (e.g. B4DJ51)
