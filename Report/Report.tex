\section{Motivation:}
Rapid genome sequencing and high-throughput technology, automatic function prediction for a novel sequence is an essential matter in bioinformatics. Automatic annotations based on local alignments suffer from several drawbacks \citep{Ori06}. With our de novo method we try to improve the precision and recall of automatic annotations.

\section{Introduction}
In the databases many proteins are found for which the sequence is known, but the function is still not determined. With the increasing number of sequences, caused for example by genomic scale projects, traditional experimental approaches have become outpaced. This leads to the need for rapid and reliable functional annotation methods \citep{Rodrigues07}. 

Many different approaches have been taken annotate protein function by computational methods, including methods based on sequence, expression, interaction and tertiary structure. Despite this taken effort and the following increase of number and variety of prediction methods, automated annotation remains difficult. Reasons for these difficulties can for example be found in the inherent limitations of current tools and databases or the ambiguity of the definition of function itself \citep{Rodrigues07}.

To overcome this problems and to be able to annotate protein function without relying on tertiary data, this method is created to reliably predict protein function by sequence alone.

%TODO what to do with this 2 paragraphs?
%Genomic scale projects have compounded the need for rapid and reliable functional annotation methods. Traditional experimental approaches have become outpaced resulting in an ever-increasing proportion of missing annotations. Computational approaches, including those based on sequence, expression, interaction and tertiary structure, have the potential to impact the growing annotation deficit.

%Despite a recent increase in the number and variety of prediction methods, the computational annotation of protein function remains difficult. This stems from a combination of issues such as the inherent limitations of current tools and databases, the difficulty of assessing the predictive power of different methods and more fundamental problems related to the ambiguity of the definition of function itself. %TODO http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S4/S1 - real paper!

\section{Material \& Methods}

Our method mainly relies on using protein sequence similarity as an indicative of functional similarity in order to transfer Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) annotations from known to unknown protein sequences. Therefore, in order to achieve a reasonable prediction, we needed a set of properly annotated and reviewed protein sequences to use as a reference database. For this we used...

We used BLAST 2.2.26 \cite{blastweb} which is a widely-used tool for protein sequence alignment, it takes as input a pre-generated database of reference protein sequences and a target sequence. It employs a heuristic algorithm to search the reference database for sequences that are most similar to the target sequence. Its main output is the top N hits sorted from the most similar to the least similar protein sequence. Additionally, it outputs a number of other values defining statistics about the degree of similarity discovered, most relevant to our method is the "bit score" value which is a statistical measure of how good the alignment is \cite{blastscore}.

Without the great help and guidance by the Rostlab, and every groupmember there, we wouldn't have been able to succeed in creating our method. Also we'd like to thank the Rostlab for letting us access their computers and equipment.
